Bugfix: SSL check when adding a public link to your ownCloud

When adding a public link to your owncloud, a SSL certificate check is performed.
Prior to this fix, the check was performed on the server's base URL, not on the
actual share URL. This could cause some problems, for example never ending redirect
loops. So now the SSL check is performed on the share URL itself.

Enhancement: Fix expiring a wrong share entry problem

Setting an app value via the occ config:app:set command to false may not result to a negation evaluation due the value will be stored in the database as 'false' type string.
As this is a non-zero value it may evaluate to true.
To come over this problem we will coerce the value:
true => 1
false => 0
